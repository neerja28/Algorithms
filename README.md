There are three elements for every algorithm:

1. Describe the Problem
2. Create a series of steps to solve the problem (well defined)
3. Perform steps to obtain a desired result (finite and effective)

Occasions to use Brute-force techniques:

1. Finding a solution, if one exixts, is essential
2. The problem size is limited
3. You can use heuristics to reduce the size of the solution set.
4. Simplicity of implementation is more important than speed

Example: Find the max- value in array which isn't sorted. 
Divide and conquer would take forever. Brute Force wins the day.

Divide and Conquer

By dividing a huge problem into small pieces so that you can understand each piece 
, you can eventually create a solution that works for the problem as a whole.

Greedy 

In some cases you can't see the end of the solution or even know whether you're winning the war. 
The only thing that you can really do is to ensure that you win each individual battles to
create a problem solution in hopes of also winning the war. 

Assumptions in Greedy Algorithm:
1. You can make a single optimal choice at a given step
2. By choocing optimal selection at each step, you can find an optimal 
solution for the overall problem.

Example: Kruskal's , Prim's, Huffman Encoding
